This is a polished up and improved module based on the `calendar2.lua` module
by Bernd Zeimetz and Marc Dequ√®nes.

### Installation

Drop the script into your awesome config folder. Suggestion:

```bash
cd ~/.config/awesome
git clone https://github.com/deficient/calendar.git
```


### Usage

In your `rc.lua`:

```lua
-- load the widget code
local calendar = require("calendar")

-- attach it as popup to your text clock widget:
calendar({}):attach(mytextclock)
```

You can also add some options to customize the widget's display. For instance:

```
local calendar = require("calendar")
calendar_widget = calendar({
  fdow = 7,                  -- Set Sunday as first day of the week (default is
                             -- 1 = Monday)
  position = "bottom_right", -- Useful if you prefer your wibox at the bottomn
                             -- of the screen
})
calendar_widget:attach(mytextclock)
```

### Requirements

* [awesome 4.0](http://awesome.naquadah.org/). May work on 3.5 with minor changes.
